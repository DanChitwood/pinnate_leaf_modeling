# Motivation
We were motivated to model lobes and leaflets within *Cannabis* leaves, so that leaves with different numbers of lobes or leaflets within a plant can be compared to each other and to discern differences between genotypes rather than the heteroblastic series. We model corresponding pseudo-landmarks for each leaflet as angle-radius coordinates relative to the petiolar junction and model angle or radius as a function of leaflet to create continuous polynomial models that bypass the problems associated with variable numbers of leaflets between leaves. 

It has been proposed that pinnate, palmate, and peltate compound leaves share a common developmental origin based on the extent of adaxial-abaxial juxtaposition that gives rises to blade (and leaflet or lobe) outgrowth along the petiole ([Kim *et al.*, *Nature* 2003](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01820)). Others have proposed methods to automatically isolate individual leaflets ([Failmezger *et al.*, *Plant Methods* 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-018-0290-y) or to model developmental trajectories, such as heteroblastic series ([Biot *et al.*, *Development* 2016](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.134619). Here, we seek to build on these works and conceptually extend our framework of continuously modeling leaflets within a palmate leaf to pinnate leaves.

# Methods
Leaflets (*Caradmine flexuosa*) and lobes (*Quercus macrocarpa*) were demarcated with two landmarks at the base and one at the tip. Along each side of a leaflet or lobe, 100 equidistanly pseudo-landmarks were placed. Each leaflet or lobe was rotated so that it was parallel to the rachis of the leaf. For each pseudo-landmark, 2nd degree polynomial models of $x$ and $y$ values were fit using the python `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` function. Five modeled leaflets or lobes were reconstructed, showing that comparable numbers of leaflets or lobes can be modeled allowing for morphometric approaches to be extended to compound leaves with differing numbers of laminar units, and feasibly across palmately and pinnately compound leaves.
